                            <p>Cal Poly, like many universities, has a Week of Welcome (WOW) where incoming students, both freshmen and transfers, are assigned a group to spend the week exploring San Luis Obispo with. As a WOW leader, I was in charge of everyone's safety and ensuring everyone was having a good time. This was a great leadership experience as managing 35 people required strong organizational and communication skills. I also learned how to foster a sense of community and belonging among my group, which was incredibly rewarding.</p>
