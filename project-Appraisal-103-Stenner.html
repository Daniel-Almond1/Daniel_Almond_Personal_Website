                            <p>This project was completed as part of my coursework for the AGB 376 Rural Property Appraisal class at California Polytechnic State University. The goal was to conduct a comprehensive appraisal of a multi-unit residential property located at 103 Stenner Street in San Luis Obispo, CA. I employed three key valuation methods: the cost approach, income approach, and sales comparison approach. Through detailed analysis, I developed a final market value estimate of $2,100,000, earning an A for this project.</p>

                            <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
                            <p>The property at 103 Stenner Street is a nine-bedroom, nine-bathroom apartment house located in a student-dense neighborhood near California Polytechnic State University. In this project, I analyzed the property’s value using standard appraisal techniques, which involved reviewing its physical condition, market potential, and zoning regulations. I also considered its rental income potential, the surrounding real estate market, and replacement costs. Ultimately, the appraisal concluded with a market value of $2,100,000 as of May 1, 2025. The analysis highlighted both the strong rental demand in the area and potential risks related to cash flow and competition.</p>
